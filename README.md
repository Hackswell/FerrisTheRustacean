# Ferris the Rustacean!
If you love the Rust (programming language), or just Rust's cute little mascot named "Ferris", this mod is for you!  
It's a simple mod that enhances the original skittering crabs, and turns them into Ferris! 
Ferris appears randomly in the following locations:
- Beach
- IslandSouth
- IslandSouthEast
- IslandWest

Groups of Ferris can dynamically spawn anywhere on the beach, or where it's diggable.  There are some _config.json_ options you can edit by hand once you run Stardew Valley once with the mod:
- **NumGroups:** How many groups of Rustaceans you want to spawn in the AllowedLocations. Default: 4.
- **MaxNumCrabsPerGroup**: Maximum number of Ferrises per group. Default: 3.
- **FerrisSkitterDistance**: Since Ferris is more friendly than regular crabs, the distance to scare Ferris off is configurable! Default: 3.
- **AllowedLocations**: Add your own custom locations!  The location must have at least some diggable area or dirt, or Ferris still won't spawn. Default: Beach, IslandWest, IslandSouth, IslandSouthEast.

## Thanks
Thanks to Discord user "Pau" for generating the original Ferris sprites! So cute!
